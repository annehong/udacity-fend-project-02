#CHANGE LOG

##20180515 Edits from rubric feedback
* -Added the meta-name/viewport
* -Changed the name of the stylesheet from "style" to "stylesheet" as to not confuse reviewer that this resembles a <style> tag
* -Although the hr was suggested, I did not change this because I like each element to be separate because at work it is easier to do in SASS/Less
* -Relabeled class names or id's to separate from closely labeled type selectors (i.e. content, hero, header, align, left, right)
* -Would like to make a note about id's (easier to use for accessibility especially for radio buttons)
* -Removed additional whitespace
* -Added this summary list to the README.MD file
